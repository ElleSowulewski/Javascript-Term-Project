This is a HTML5 & Javascript game inspired by RPGs
and board games.

Play by clicking the roll button for the first die,
you can see what you rolled by the image above. A
second roll button will appear under the second die, 
click that button to roll it and you can see what you 
rolled by the image above.
Then the sword image will change and the lives counter
will update based on the results:

	-If you rolled higher than the computer, you 
	 will attack and the player will lose a life.

	-If you rolled lower than the computer, the
	 computer will attack and you will lose a life.

	-If you and the computer rolled the same, both
	 attacks are blocked and no-one loses a life.

Click the 'Again!' button to roll again. You win if
you bring the computer's lives to zero. You lose if 
the computer brings your lives to zero.

Future release plans:
	-Add more styling
	-Fix the problem where the lives and the battle
	 image do not update before the alert box comes
	 up on a lose or win.
